# Solution-to-Matrices
Finds the unique solution vector "x" to any size "m" x "n" matrix and answer vector "b".
Prerequisites: Visual Studio 2019 Community with C++ Developer Package (Free)

Summary: Finds the unique solution vector "x" to any size "m" x "n" matrix and answer vector "b".

Instructions: Open the Source.cpp in Visual Studio and select the Green Arrow at the top that says "Local Windows Debugger". Follow prompt instructions to enjoy the game!

Math Explanation: This program uses vector and double vectors with rowpushback loops to form matrices according to the user input then it checks for uniques solution by calculating the determinant. It then calculates and creates the adjoint and inverse matrices and uses the inverse and original matrix to form the unique solution vector.
